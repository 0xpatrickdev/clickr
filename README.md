## To Do:

- fine tune indexing from [Guidebox API](https://api.guidebox.com/)
	- add application links for Netlfix
-  Allow users to cast multiple apps/channels (or any HTML5 video url)
	- Rokus, Smart TV's, and Chromecasts:
		- Add support for [DIAL](http://www.dial-multiscreen.org/), the Discover And Launch protocol developed by Google and Netflix
		- If you've ever seen this icon: <img src="http://rabbittv.s3.amazonaws.com/Support.rabbittvgo.com/google-cast-2ab.jpg" alt="DIAL" width="51px">, that's DIAL.
	- Apple TV:
		- Add support for [Air Play](https://developer.apple.com/airplay/)
- Focus primarily on Netflix, HBO Go/Now, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and YouTube Red.
	- Show overlap between providers
	- Show where certain content is available for free, legally (i.e. Southpark and Hulu)
	- Highlight recently added content, as well as content that is expiring in the near features
- Allow users to track show/movie's they've watched, sort of like facebook used to do back in the day:
